		/* main is the primary f that runs. 
			An f is a series of commands separated by semicolon. (inspired by assembly) 
			They execute top to bottom.
			When main gets to the bottom, the machine and the music terminates.

			Commands:
				label label_name
					name curent location in script, so we can jump to it.

				goto label_name
					jump to label
				goto label_name 0.3
				  jump to label 30% of the time (else continue 70% of the time)
			  goto L1 0.5 L2 0.5
					jump to L1 half the time, jump to L2 half the time 
				goto A 0.1 B 0.15
					jump to A 10% of the time, jump to B 15% of the time (else continue 75% of the time)
				goto X 0.6, Y 0.6, Z 0.6
				  error: sum of probabilities > 1.0

				play section_name
					play the audio (whose start and duration are defined above inside "sections"), continue when completed

				f script_name
					jump to the subroutine (defined inside "machine"); when completed jump back here 

				terminate
					end the music, end the machine


				Advanced stuff----

					Stack Overflow
						There is a subroutine stack. 
						Calling f adds a subroutine to the stack. 
						Exiting a subroutine pops it from the stack. 
						If you go too deeply you may get "stack overflow".
					
					Label Scope 
						labels are scoped only within the subroutine they were defined.
					
					f main
						It is possible to call "f main", and for a subroutine to call itself. Warning: may cause stackoverflow 

					label names and f names must be only: [A-Za-z0-9_] 
					Everything is case-insensitive.
